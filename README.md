# TODO:

- [ ] abstract

- [x] possible refactoring (split implementations in two .py files) and use notebook only for results and conclusions

- [ ] for introduction, general problem, existing methods, applications

- [x] comparison execution time for different runs (isolation tree, kmeans tree, isolation ensemble, kmeans ensemble)
- [x] parallelize the ensembles (both isolation and kmeans)

- [x] compare times execution with already existing implementations (only isolation tree (can use forest with t=1) and isolation ensemble) (these two are from sklearn)
try other github implementations (also for kmeans tree and ensemble)

- [ ] complexity (brief explanation)

- [ ] brief mention of other approaches from same familty SOTA + brief technical details

- [ ] pseudocode in latex for implementations
- [x] comparison with original authors (if they have any implementations) (both papers don't seem to have)

- [x] sensibility to parameters (higher contaminations for real datasets, ensemble size, subsampling size?)

- [ ] conclusions + future improvements
